# Business Insights:

The sales from Januvary to June are very good through out the year so we need to concentrate on remaining months with different discount in order to increase sales.

Among 4 stores S1 is having highest sales i.e., is followed bu S4 ,S2 ,S3 So need to concentrate more on S2 and S3 to improve orders in this store.

Totally we are having 4 locations among those L1 is having huge sales that means more orders for the products are also in L1 location only

Where as in L4 and L5 are very low so need to think about these locations to improve the orders indirectly we can increase sales and also profit from the locations .

All the Regions sales are ok but R4 is having low.

Number of orders in R4 is very low so sales are also low here.

The sales on non-holiday days i.e, working days are 164K , sales on holiday days are 25K.

Discount in store S1 high , i think by this reason sales and orders are also high. I think by this time people got adopted to buy products in this store.

So now they can decrease Discount in S1 and increase discount in store S3 in order to attrack people to buy products in store S3 acording we can increase sales and orders .

Similarlly they can implement in L4 and L5 , so that it can help the products to sale more and can gain profit in long run.

Generally there is a huge drop of sales after May. So we need to try to know why this has been in happening.

After Knowing reasons we can make changes accordingly in order to avoid product wastage and also increase profit and sales and increase discount according to store type, location and region.

We should not only concentrate on Sales and profit. Where as concentrate on what products are being ordered more by people in different locations.

And also provide Discount on orders According to seasonality like festival, vaction holidays etc, Inorder to attract people as well as childrens .

So that we can make people adapted to store automatically we can increase sales and products will sell on time so no product will go out of stock when ever required as well as will not get wasted.
